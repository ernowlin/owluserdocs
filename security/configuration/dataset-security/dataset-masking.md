# Dataset Masking

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSecurity/Dataset%20Masking.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.
{% endhint %}

## Masking From the UI

After an owlcheck has been run you can perform column level masking from the hoot page if you have ROLE\_ADMIN or ROLE\_DATASET\_MANAGER.

{% hint style="info" %}
Masking updates will take effect for all existing and future runs of the selected dataset.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
ROLE\_ADMIN and ROLE\_DATASET\_MANAGER also have the ability to unmask.
{% endhint %}
