# Local User Store Authentication

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSecurity/Local%20User%20Store%20Authentication.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.
{% endhint %}

Local user store authentication is enabled by default, and the product ships with a default user with admin privileges. If you should need to toggle this mechanism on/off you can find the setting by navigating to the Admin Console and clicking on the Security Icon. The setting labeled "Local User Store Enabled" when checked will allow your company to create and administer users stored in Collibra Data Quality's internal database user store. Toggling this feature will require a restart of the web application.
