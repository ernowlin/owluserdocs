# Assists Data Aggregation

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSolutions/Assists%20Data%20Aggregation.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

* **Greatly reduce Support Costs.** Apply AI-generated rules to maintain consistency across all accounts, rather than apply hand-made rules per every account. You are not managing 100+ variations of rules, but a consistent set that is learned from all.
* **Capitalize on Real-time.** Batch collection with excel compare will never support real-time. Instead, rules are generated by the data itself, and anomalies are triggered on the fly at the source system.
* **Rapid Onboarding.** Universal and already tested Scans are applied quickly.
* **Improve Customer Satisfaction.** Monitor the real-time speed of the DQ pushdown fix, not just the overall DQ score over time.
* **Improved SLAs.** When DQ is fixed immediately, all SLAs can be improved not just DQ SLAs.
