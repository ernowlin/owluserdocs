# Builds a Better DQ Dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSolutions/Builds%20a%20Better%20DQ%20Dashboard.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

* **DQ Dashboards.** Many DQ problems result from an improper or a too slow observation of business rules related to the data. What is not caught by handmade visual inspection or a potentially outdated man-made rule can only be flagged by AI Machine Learning. Conversely, what does get flagged should also be easily triaged and then immediately fixed with the aid of AI. The most important metric for a DQ Dashboard is the time to fix, not simply the overall DQ score.
