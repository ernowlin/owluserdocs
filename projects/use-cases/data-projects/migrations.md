# Speeds Migrations/Enables Replications

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSolutions/Speeds%20MigrationsEnables%20Replications.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

* **Speed Migrations/Enable Replications.** Batch collection with subsequent excel compare is very problematic. Instead, rules are generated by the data itself, and anomalies are triggered on the fly at the source system. This type of schema learned approach will speed migration and enable replications with much less overhead.
