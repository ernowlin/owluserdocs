# Ensures CCPA & GDPR

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSolutions/Ensures%20CCPA%20&%20GDPR.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Aggregation from 100s of locations. The dashboard for what is within spec based on AI observation â€“ not handmade rules.

Then push-down fix. The rules are created and then immediately applied via self-service. The problem is immediately identified and a fix (recommendation engine) is applied.

The Value of this for both companies. The DQ problem never corrupts the whole. The longer the bad quality exists the bigger problem it can create.
