We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQSolutions/Health%20Insurance%20Claims%20Data.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Revenue Cycle Management is the process of identifying, collecting and managing the practiceâ€™s revenue from payers based on the services provided. A complete RCM process is critical for a healthcare practice to maintain financial viability and continue to provide quality care for their patients.

Inaccurate claims data, is the primary cause for diagnostic providers receiving incorrect payments for their services. Most providers struggle with the quality of the data that they receive, and without direct access to the patients, it can be an expensive, laborious process to correct incomplete, or missing data that is required for claim reimbursement.

Cleaning up or correcting incomplete data is not a step in the claims process that can be skipped. It must be done to assure the reimbursement process is accurate, and complete in the agreed time frame. Automating the data quality during intake is the key to the timely completion of the reimbursement process, and saving the cost and effort of correcting the data down stream.
