# AutoProfile

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQApis/AutoProfile.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

**AutoProfile** allows you to select a set of databases and tables to quickly be cataloged. Each selected table will be profiled and added to the Owl Catalog via the selected agent. Various parameters like Alerts, Job Schedules, limits, and more can also be set.

â€ŒWhen you expand a datasource in the **Explorer** page, you're given a list of possible databases and their associated tables. **AutoProfile** is triggered when you select the ones you want and hit scan. This will take you to a separate page that allows you to configure the various AutoProfile parameters.

A SparkSubmit will be launched for each table, so make sure the agent configuration is reasonable and the box has enough resources to handle each job.

**Global Parameters**
