# Livy

## What is Livy?

At its core, Apache Livy is an optional component that changes how the **Collibra DQ** **Web** app caches remote files. From **Explorer**, Livy allows for interaction with Spark clusters over REST APIs. This is especially useful with larger data or Spark clusters, because with Livy, you can drill into those bigger files.

In a future release, we plan to make Livy a standard component as part of our data visualization, but as of 2022.04 it remains optional. An orange icon shows cached remote files.
