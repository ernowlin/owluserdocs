#### The rule library contains both OOTB and custom-built rule templates.

### OOTB Rules

Collibra Data Quality shares all of its out of the box rules with each user/tenant. This makes it easy to get started quickly and lets the team add common rules for specific use cases.&#x20;

Below is a list of one-click rules that can be added to any data set. It is important to note that Collibra Data Quality often self-identifies these columns and automatically provides the proper protection.

* Email
* Zip
* Credit Card
* SSN
* EIN
* State Code
* Phone
* Gender
* IP Address
* Date
* Int
* Double

The quick rule dropdown is another way to apply rules at the click of a button from the Preview tab.

### Customized Rules

#### Add to the Rule Library

Create a rule once using our rule template builder and re-use the rule across any column on any data set. Collibra Data Quality substitutes the data set and column to which the rule applies at runtime. This commonly saves hundreds of redundant rules that do the same thing but on different column names.

The Rule Library hosts out of the box and custom global rules. See data concepts and semantics for advanced use of global rules.
