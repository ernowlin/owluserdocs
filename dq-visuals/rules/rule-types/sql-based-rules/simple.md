We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQCoreComponents/Simple\_2.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Depending on the complexity, users can choose from short form or long form rules.

#### **Simple**

Just the condition (short form). For example, using the column email\_address. This runs against the dataframe and uses Spark SQL syntax. Simple rules can be thought of as everything after the where clause.

```
email_address is not null and email_address != '' 
```

{% hint style="info" %}
All built-in spark functions are available to use. ([https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/)) for simple and freeform sql rules.â€Œ
