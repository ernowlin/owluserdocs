description: Just the condition after the "where" clause

# Simple

Depending on the complexity, users can choose from short form or long form rules.

#### **Simple**

Just the condition (short form). For example, using the column email\_address. This runs against the dataframe and uses Spark SQL syntax. Simple rules can be thought of as everything after the where clause.

```
email_address is not null and email_address != '' 
```

All built-in spark functions are available to use. ([https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/)) for simple and freeform sql rules.â€Œ
