We're moving! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide is moving to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/Home.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](../../) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide will be maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center following the 2022.11 release.&#x20;

Read more to understand if specific dimensions can be applied to your data.
