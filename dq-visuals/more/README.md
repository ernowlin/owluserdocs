{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQCoreComponents/to\_more.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

When specific DQ challenges require specific DQ detection techniques, Collibra DQ offers a wide variety of advanced functionality. While Schema and Shapes utilize auto-discovery, other detection algorithms are best suited for users that understand their data and have specific use-cases in mind. Read more to understand if specific dimensions can be applied to your data.
