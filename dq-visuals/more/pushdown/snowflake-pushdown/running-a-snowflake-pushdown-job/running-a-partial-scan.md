# Running a Partial Scan

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 2022.08, Snowflake Pushdown is only available as a private beta for participating customers. Since this is a beta feature, some capabilities may be limited.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

A partial scan only scans the sections of your table that you specify. Select columns, apply row filters, and add DQ Layers to finetune your DQ scan and obtain a targeted understanding of your data.&#x20;

## Prerequisites

You have an [active Snowflake connection](../../../../../connecting-to-dbs-in-owl-web/supported-drivers/connectivity-to-snowflake.md) and [Pushdown enabled](../../../../../connecting-to-dbs-in-owl-web/supported-drivers/connectivity-to-snowflake.md).

## Steps

1. From Explorer, select your Snowflake connection with the ![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/dq-pushdown-icon.png) icon next to it.\
   **Note:** For the ![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/dq-pushdown-icon.png) icon to be visible, you need to enable Pushdown when you establish your Snowflake connection.
2. Select your schema.
3. Click Create DQ Job.\
   \>> The Job creator page opens.
4. Select **Partial Scan**.\
   \>> The **Select columns** view appears.
5. Select your columns by checking or unchecking the checkboxes associated with a particular column. \
   Optionally assign a Key and Link ID.&#x20;
6. Click **Next**. \
   Alternatively, you can also click **Select rows** from the left workflow menu.\
   \>> The Select rows view appears.
7. Select a filter type to apply a specific filter.&#x20;

| Filter Type | Description                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Time Slice  | Scans a range of dates or times. |
| Row Filter  | Scans a section of rows.         |
| Limit       | Scans a random sample of rows.   |

8\. Click **Next**. \
&#x20;   Alternatively, you can also click **Add layers** from the left workflow menu.\
&#x20;   \>> The Add layers view appears.

9\. Optionally add layers or toggle default settings.&#x20;

* Certain AdaptiveRules are enabled by default. You can optionally toggle them on and off.
* Shapes are enabled by default. You can optionally toggle them on and off, and configure more advanced options by selecting the Manual checkbox.&#x20;

10\. Click **Next**.\
&#x20;     \>> The Review page opens.

11\. Review your DQ scan.&#x20;

12\. Select **Run**.\
&#x20;     \>> A dialog appears and tracks the status of your Snowflake Pushdown job.

### Time Slice

Time slice is a filter that lets you select a range of dates or times for your DQ scan. To apply a time slice filter, select **Add**, **** configure your preferences in the Add Time Slice modal, then select **Save** to save your filter. When a filter is successfully saved, a badge displays on the Time Slice tile, and the number of applied filters is reflected in the left workflow menu.&#x20;
