# Shapes (automatic)

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQCoreComponents/Shapes%20\(automatic\).htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Owl will automatically detect inconsistencies in data formats. These inconsistencies are where Data Scientists spend an enormous amount of time cleaning the data before building a ML model. Many reports have documented that over 80% of the time it takes to build a credible model comes from first understanding all the different formats and then writing munging or ETL style code to clean it before processing. What about all the patterns the process or person doesn't even know about?
