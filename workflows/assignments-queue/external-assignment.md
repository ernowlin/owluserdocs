# External assignment

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQWorkflows/External%20assignment.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.
{% endhint %}

Collibra Data Quality & Observability has the ability to link to an Assignment Queue. You can assign any item to a user that has previously logged into the application and has a matching Service Now account. Choose the configured queue from the assignment drop-down list after selecting the **Validate** option from the actions drop-down list as previously described.

To configure a queue, you must have ROLE\_ADMIN or ROLE\_CONNECTION\_MANAGER.

Go to the **Admin Console** and click **Assignment Queues**.
