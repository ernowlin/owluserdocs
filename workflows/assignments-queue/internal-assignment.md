# Internal Assignment

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/Internal%20Assignment.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.
{% endhint %}

Collibra Data Quality & Observability has a built-in Assignments Queue. You can assign any item to a user that has previously logged into the application. Select OwlDQ from the assignment dropdown after choosing the Validate option from the actions dropdown.&#x20;
