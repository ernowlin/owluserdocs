# FAQ

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQWorkflows/FAQ.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

## Can anyone assign an item?

Anyone with access to the dataset and TRAIN role (if enabled) can assign an item. Users who have been assigned an item can resolve without the TRAIN role.

## How do I add people to the assignment list

Once a person logs into the Collibra Data Quality application, they will get a profile and become eligible for assignment.
