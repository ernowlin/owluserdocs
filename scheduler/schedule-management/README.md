# Schedule Management

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/Scheduler/Schedule%20Management.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Enable Scheduled Jobs from your environment variable in owl-env.sh

SCHEDULE\_ENABLED = TRUE/FALSE (Default = TRUE)

Limit Scheduler Open Time-slots:

If you don't want automated jobs to be running during business hours, or for a particular day/time on any given day of the week you can set "off-limit" times so authorized users don't select them when scheduling a job.
