We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/Installation/CloudNativeDeployment/EKS%20%20GKE%20%20AKS.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.
