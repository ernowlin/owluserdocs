# Catalog Bulk Actions

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQCatalog/Catalog%20Bulk%20Actions.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Each data set row will now have a checkbox in the Actions column. All filters can be applied now and the user can check all data sets they wish to delete. Once desired datasets are selected, the checkbox can be clicked. The user will be prompted to confirm they wish to delete datasets. The user can also click the X button to cancel.
