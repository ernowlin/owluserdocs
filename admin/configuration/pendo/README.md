# Pendo

{% hint style="info" %}
We've moved! To improve customer experience, the Collibra Data Quality User Guide has moved to the [Collibra Documentation Center](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/DataQuality/DQAdmin/Pendo.htm) as part of the Collibra Data Quality 2022.11 release. To ensure a seamless transition, [dq-docs.collibra.com](http://dq-docs.collibra.com/) will remain accessible, but the DQ User Guide is now maintained exclusively in the Documentation Center.

Pendo is an analytics application embedded in Collibra that helps us analyze, develop, and improve our product. No sensitive information is ever collected, we only leverage high-level usage statistics to improve our offerings. If no modifications are made to the default settings, Pendo will not block or impair the intended functionality of Collibra Data Quality in any way.

### Pendo in a standalone environment

If you install a standalone environment, modify the \<install-dir>/config/owl-env.sh file by adding your license name\
`export DQ_INTEGRATION_PENDO_ACCOUNTID=<your-license-name>`
